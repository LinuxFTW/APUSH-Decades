# Hello!

This is some data processing I did for APUSH to get these packets we got into various forms. One being the full prompt and the matching  year being a flash card, one being just one and the matching year, and the final being just one and the wikipedia summary.

Hope someone  can find this useful!

# Folders:
- cropped - These are the GIMP files of the cropped images

- img - These are the raw PNGs extracted from the PDF

- txt - this is the folder with all of the scripts and extracted text in it, as well as the Anki cards.

- txt/Cards - This directory contains all of the Anki cards

- txt/CSV - This contains all of the Anki cards exported into .csv format for upload to Quizlet

- txt/src - This is just the text and the answers (extracted using tesseract) and then all merged into one file
