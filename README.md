# Hello!

This is some data processing I did for APUSH to get these packets we got into various forms. One being the full prompt and the matching  year being a flash card, one being just one and the matching year, and the final being just one and the wikipedia summary.

Hope someone  can find this useful!

# Folders:
- cropped - These are the GIMP files of the cropped images

- img - These are the raw PNGs extracted from the PDF

- txt - this is the folder with all of the scripts and extracted text in it, as well as the Anki cards.

- txt/Cards - This directory contains all of the Anki cards

- txt/CSV - This contains all of the Anki cards exported into .csv format for upload to Quizlet

- txt/src - This is just the text and the answers (extracted using tesseract) and then all merged into one file

# Deck Types
There were three deck types made. Each question was built in the format of a list of three to four items and the corresponding decade it was from. 
The "master" deck splits each item and its corresponoding decade into a separate card. If "1,2,3,4" paired up with "1980s", there would be one
card for each "1" - "1980", "2" - "1980", etc.

The non-unique one pairs each decade up with the entire pairing. If "1,2,3,4" paired up with "1980s", the card would be a pairing of "1,2,3,4"
\- "1980".

The masochist deck is by far the most interesting. For each individual item, "1", "2", "3", and "4", the first paragraph of the wikipedia article
about each was setup. EG "1" - "Paragraph about the number one", "2" - "Paragraph about the number two", etc.

That should be it for documentation! If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.
